## Overview
Don’t Be Late! is an easy way to track punctuality – whether you’re trying to be on time more often or just keeping tabs on which of your friends is always running late. Quickly log delays, add reasons, and see trends over time. No clutter, no complications – just an easy way to stay on top of time.

## Approach
This app is built using 100% SwiftUI. I used SwiftData for Data Management and SwiftUI for building the views, which allowed me to build a very performant and accessible app.
