## Approach
The approach to developing the site was centered around creating an intuitive, visually appealing and mobile-first platform. It uses a highly modular layout system for easy editing. The website is built with Elementor and uses WordPress as CMS. It now scores 96/100 performance points and 100/100 SEO points.
