overview: "For the Homburger Frühlingsball 2024, I developed a modern visual identity that included poster design, printed tickets, and digital assets for the event’s website. The redesign aimed to refresh the old card design while staying visually connected to Rotary’s established color palette of blue and yellow. The final design draws inspiration from the Bauhaus movement, using bold geometry and a clean, structured layout to establish a timeless identity."
approach: "Guided by the principles of Bauhaus design, I used simple geometric forms and the complementary contrast of blue and warm yellow to create a modern and minimalistic asthetic. The year “2024” is written in gemetrical shapes in varying shades of blue. The modern and large typography ensures clarity across both print and digital formats. The layout was optimized for legibility and consistency across all media — from physical tickets and posters to screen-ready graphics for the event website."
