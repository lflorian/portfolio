overview: "EnergyAdvisor is an IOT Device whose goal is to reduce CO2-Emissions by shifting power demand. The integrated AdvisorLED acts like a traffic light. If there's an excess of renewable energies, the advisor LED goes green. According to our calculations, EnergyAdvisor could save up to 901kg of CO2eq per household per year. In combination with flexible electricity tariffs, whose popularity is increasing rapidly, EnergyAdvisor could save not only CO2 but also money. Possible use cases include solar power systems at home."
approach: "The prototype of EnergyAdvisor is built using an Arduino Nano like ESP32 board. The microcontroller has to have a WiFi-Chip because emission data is requested via the electricitymaps.com API. The case for the prototype was printed using a Bambu Lab A1 3d printer. The code for Energy Advisor is written in C++ and is available on GitHub. I am currently working on integrating solar systems for home use and a new WiFi-Setup experience. A more compact case is also on the horizon."
