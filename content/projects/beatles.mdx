overview: "I created a complete visual identity for a Beatles tribute concert, including posters, flyers, and animated stage visuals. The design was inspired by the feel of the Rubber Soul album."
approach: "To capture the spirit of the 1960s while appealing to a modern audience, I combined the retro color palette of the album with the clean geometry of the Montserrat typeface. The original Beatles logo was incorporated, while the layout and motion elements brought a dynamic feel to both print and ProPresenter visuals. The print designs were created with Pixelmator Pro."
