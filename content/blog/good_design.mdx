title: Design is judgment, not democracy.
description: “You decide” seems to be Apple’s new design philosophy — and it’s a mistake. Great design isn’t about giving people choices — it’s about making the right ones for them.

### What makes good design?

At WWDC20, Apple did something uncharacteristically loud for a company that is usually known for quiet confidence. Rumors were spreading about a possible merge of macOS and iPadOS which caused Craig Federighi himself to deliver the bold message: "No."
This ginormous slide described Apple's design philosophy in a single word. It was Apple saying: we know best what these products are, and we know what they are not. We're not here to let the crowd decide but we're here to lead.

### Somewhere along the way, that philosophy slipped.

With iOS 17, Apple let you move the Safari address bar – top or bottom. iOS 26 now introduces an updated phone app with a new layout – which can be turned off. Also new: Liquid Glass. A visual effect that users immediately wanted to tweak. "Let us decide the opacity!", "Come on Apple, just add a slider!". Apple is starting to listen more often. But they shouldn't.

This is about clarity, vision and judgment.

As Steve Jobs put it: “Some people say give the customers what they want. But that’s not my approach. It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”

Focus groups are the illusion of insight. They sound scientific, but result in design-by-consensus – a surefire way to average out anything exceptional. Jobs rejected them because great design doesn't emerge from a poll.

Henry Ford allegedly said: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Users frame their desires based on what they know. It's not their job to imagine the future. That's the designer's job.

We've all seen what happens when users get too much control. UX Nightmares are created because users aren't designers. Not because they lack taste or intelligence, but because they haven't trained the muscle. They haven't spent years refining ment, learning what to remove, what to simplify, what to say no to.

### I love democracy. But good design isn't democracy. Good design is guided, not crowdsourced.

Jobs understood this. Apple, for years, internalized it. When design teams were torn between two options, the answer wasn't "let the user choose." The answer was: keep working until the right answer is obvious. One solution: elegant, default.

### "You decide" is not a design philosophy. It's a shrug.

In recent years, Apple has started to shrug more. From customizable lock screens, icon shapes, fonts, widgets and color themes, the operating system has slowly morphed from curated to configurable. And with each new option, Apple chips away at its own authority – the trust that users once placed in its defaults.

Liquid Glass is just the latest symptom. It's flashy, but in its current form, it harms readability. And the defense? "You can turn it off." If the best defense of a feature is "you can disable it", then it probably shouldn't ship in the first place.

### The best design doesn't ask the user to solve the problem. It solves it before they notice it existed.

Android is a land of 1000 toggles. And Apple? It used to be a sanctuary from that. iPhones just worked. Now they… invite tweaking.

This isn't about being anti-choice. It's about recognizing that great design isn't made by giving users control over every aesthetic detail. 

### Great design is having the restraint to say no – especially when it's tempting to say yes.

Jony Ive once said: "What we make testifies who we are. People can sense care and can sense carelessness."

Letting users pick is carelessness. It's saying: we gave up. We don't know the answer. So you decide.

### Bring back "No."

Not just as a slide at WWDC, but as a mindset. Because saying no isn't about limitation, it's about leadership.
