The Apple Watch has always stood out as a uniquely successful piece of technology. It elegantly blends hardware and software into a wearable that genuinely improves daily life. I’ve relied on its glanceable information, fast interactions, and overall consistency. But with watchOS 10, Apple has—intentionally or not—moved away from what made the Apple Watch great.

Let me explain why I think the new direction is problematic.

### A Fragmented, Inconsistent UI

One of the most noticeable issues with watchOS 10 is how inconsistent the user interface has become. In previous versions, UI patterns felt logical and unified. Now? It’s a patchwork.
	•	Notifications can still be swiped away top-to-bottom—but other popups must be dismissed with a small “X” in the upper-left corner, which is sluggish and sometimes buggy.
	•	Others still require tapping a bottom-placed button to close. Why are there three different interaction methods for closing popups?

These inconsistencies chip away at one of Apple’s core design strengths: predictability. Users shouldn’t have to guess how to interact with each element on a screen.

### Stateful UI Elements Losing Their State

Another baffling change is how some toggle switches behave. The familiar green slider—used consistently across the OS to indicate state—is still present in places. But in Low Power Mode, it’s gone. Instead, you’re presented with a long info screen that must be scrolled through before enabling it.

It’s not just inconsistent—it’s inefficient. It turns what used to be a 1-second toggle into a multi-step interaction. On a device designed for quick glances and short sessions, that’s a UX failure.

### The Smart Stack Feels Like a Step Back

The new Smart Stack feature had potential, but the execution is deeply flawed.

Now there are two ways to access the Smart Stack: swiping up from the watch face or turning the Digital Crown. This wouldn’t be a problem—except that the Digital Crown was previously used to interact with certain watch faces. With watchOS 10, rotating the Crown hijacks that interaction and opens the Smart Stack instead.

This design choice ruins the usability of beautiful, functional watch faces like Solar Dial or Astronomy, which relied on the Crown for dynamic interaction.

Even worse: the Smart Stack redundantly displays the time and date—information that’s already available on the watch face itself. It’s a cluttered, confusing experience that doesn’t respect the “glanceable” philosophy the Apple Watch was built on.

A more natural design would’ve been to assign the Smart Stack to the side button. That way, it could be invoked from within apps too, and the Control Center swipe gesture (which many users still rely on) could have remained untouched.

### Loss of Glanceability

The updated Weather app is a missed opportunity. Tapping the app from the watch face now opens… the exact same information you just tapped on, only with larger font and a brighter background. Want the forecast? Scroll.

This might seem minor, but it’s emblematic of a broader shift. The Apple Watch was built for utility, not grandeur. The new Weather and Activity apps feel more like iPhone ports than watch-native experiences. They take too long to navigate and require too many interactions to access information that was once instantly available.

### The App Store Doesn’t Belong Here

The introduction of a full-fledged App Store on watchOS may be well-intentioned, but in my opinion, it misses the mark. The Apple Watch was never meant to be a standalone computing device—it shines when it works in harmony with the iPhone.

Browsing and downloading apps from a tiny screen feels clunky and off-brand for Apple. More useful would have been an improved integration with the iPhone, making it easier to manage watch apps, timers, alarms, and other shared services.

Speaking of timers and alarms: why does my watch act independently of my phone when I set a timer? I expect a unified experience, not silos.

## Final Thoughts

Apple has never been afraid to rethink its platforms. But with watchOS 10, it feels like form has started to overtake function. The interface is inconsistent, gesture logic is muddled, and core apps feel bloated.

As a developer and daily Apple Watch user, I miss the clarity and elegance that once defined watchOS. I hope future updates will refocus on what made the Apple Watch great in the first place: thoughtful, glanceable, and cohesive user experiences.
