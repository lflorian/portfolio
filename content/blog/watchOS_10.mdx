The Apple Watch has always stood out as a uniquely successful piece of technology. It elegantly blends hardware and software into a wearable that genuinely improves daily life. I’ve relied on its glanceable information, fast interactions, and overall consistency. But with watchOS 10, Apple has—intentionally or not—moved away from what made the Apple Watch great.

Let me explain why I think the new direction is problematic.

### A Fragmented, Inconsistent UI

One of the most noticeable issues with watchOS 10 is how inconsistent the user interface has become. In previous versions, UI patterns felt logical and unified. Now it’s a patchwork of mismatched behaviors.
	•	Notifications can still be swiped away top-to-bottom.
	•	Popups require a small “X” in the upper-left corner—a sluggish, inconsistent hit target.
	•	Some screens must be dismissed via a bottom-placed button.

Three different methods to do the same thing: dismiss. That’s not innovation. That’s confusion.

These inconsistencies chip away at one of Apple’s design cornerstones: predictability. Users shouldn’t have to guess how to interact with each screen.

### Simple Toggles, Buried Deep

Take Low Power Mode. It used to be a straightforward toggle in Control Center, just like on iOS. One tap: done. In watchOS 10?
	•	Tap the Control Center battery icon.
	•	Enter a fullscreen battery screen.
	•	Tap “Low Power Mode.”
	•	Read a full-screen modal explaining what it does.
	•	Scroll all the way down.
	•	Tap “Enable.”
	•	Confirm again.

That’s a seven-step process to do something that used to take one. It’s not just inefficient; it’s hostile to the fundamental Apple Watch idea: short, glanceable interactions.

### Smart Stack, Dumb Interaction

The new Smart Stack was meant to bring intelligence to the watch face. But its implementation? Frustrating.
	•	You can open it by swiping up—or by turning the Digital Crown.
	•	But turning the Crown used to be reserved for watch face interactions. With watchOS 10, that interaction is hijacked.

That means faces like Solar Dial and Astronomy—which once used the Crown to show time progression—are now broken. Apple didn’t just add a new feature; they overwrote an existing one without providing alternatives.

To make matters worse, the Smart Stack redundantly shows time and date, which are already on the watch face. It’s cluttered. It breaks flow. It feels more like a demo than a refined feature.

A better solution? Map Smart Stack to the side button. This approach would make it possible to keep the beloved swipe-up for control center gesture.

### Glanceability Is Losing Ground

The Weather app is a small but telling example. In previous versions, tapping a complication gave you a quick forecast. In watchOS 10?
	•	You tap the complication.
	•	You see… the same information, just bigger.
	•	Want a forecast? Scroll.

Yes, Apple fixed this later. But the initial design missed the point of the Watch entirely. Bigger isn’t better if the interaction takes longer.

Same for the redesigned Activity app. More pages. More taps. Less glanceability.

The Apple Watch should complement your phone, not compete with it. If it takes more than a couple of seconds, it belongs on the iPhone.

### The App Store Doesn’t Belong Here

Adding a full App Store to the watch was a mistake.
	•	Nobody wants to browse app listings on a 41mm screen.
	•	It breaks the flow of the device.

The Watch shines when it’s an extension of the phone—not a replacement for it. Apple should have doubled down on tight integration, not feature bloat.

And while we’re on the subject: why are timers and alarms still managed independently between devices? Set a timer on iPhone, it stays there. Set one on Watch, it’s not reflected anywhere else. That’s not elegant. That’s disjointed.

### Final Thoughts

Apple is never afraid to rethink its platforms. But with watchOS 10, it feels like they’re forgetting what made the Watch a success in the first place: simplicity, speed, and clarity.

Now? Interactions are longer. UIs are inconsistent. Core features feel less thoughtful. And all of it adds up.

watchOS 10 isn’t a disaster. But it’s a step backward—one that trades user intuition for feature checkboxes.

Here’s hoping watchOS 11 finds its footing again. And remembers what the Watch is really for: not longer sessions, not standalone apps, but quick, purposeful, and delightful moments.
